# React Portfolio

## Description

This is a porfolio website I created to display my initial skills with HTML and CSS. I was motivated to build it so I can practice basic coding skills, and it provides a solution for contacting me and seeing my work.

Requirements:
 -developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
 -click one of the links in the navigation THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
 -click on the link to the section about their work THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
 -I am presented with the developer's first application THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
 -click on the images of the applications THEN I am taken to that deployed application
 -resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
