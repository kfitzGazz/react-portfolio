This is a porfolio website I created to display my initial skills with HTML and CSS that I have now deployed on REACT. I was motivated to deploy on REACT for real-world experience.

vite, npm i, npm start

## Usage

This used REACT and will be used as a basic building block to build my portfolio skills.
